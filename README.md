Delhi Climate Sentinel
Innovators Conclave 2025 Winning Project — Team Nivaaran
Overview

Delhi Climate Sentinel is a data-driven climate intelligence platform designed to assess and visualize Delhi’s climate resilience. It integrates AI, geospatial visualization, and multi-source datasets to generate actionable insights for monitoring air, water, and infrastructure risks.

Problem Statement

Delhi faces recurring challenges from hazardous air quality, water scarcity, and unplanned urban growth. Data on these issues remains fragmented, limiting effective analysis and timely interventions.

Solution

A web-based system combining real-time data, AI predictions, and visual analytics through a unified Resilience Equity Score (RES) Engine and interactive map-based dashboard.

Core Components
1. Resource Equity Score (RES) Engine

The RES Engine computes a resilience score (0–100), where lower scores indicate higher risk.
Formula:
RES = 100 – [W₁(Air Risk) + W₂(Water Deficit) + W₃(Urban Density Factor)]

W₁, W₂, W₃ are weighting factors based on environmental impact.

Air Risk is weighted highest due to direct health implications.

2. Interactive Map Dashboard

Built with Leaflet.js and GeoJSON layers.

Displays district-wise resilience zones using color-coded thresholds.

Users can view air, water, and infrastructure data overlays.

3. AI Insights and Prediction

Project Status

Project Status: 75% completed — RES engine functional, dashboard live, AI predictions at 82% accuracy, and real-time API integration underway.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Visualization: Leaflet.js
