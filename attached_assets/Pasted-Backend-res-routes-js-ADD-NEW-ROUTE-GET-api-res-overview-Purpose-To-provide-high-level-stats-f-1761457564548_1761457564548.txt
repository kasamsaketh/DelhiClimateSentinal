Backend (res.routes.js)
ADD NEW ROUTE: GET /api/res/overview

Purpose: To provide high-level stats for the LandingPage.

Returns: A JSON object: { "cityWideRes": 45, "activeAlerts": 3, "status": "Stressed" } (simulated).

Frontend (App.jsx)
Purpose: Must now wrap the application in AppContext.Provider and BrowserRouter.

Logic:

Render the persistent <Navbar /> and <AlertTicker />.

Define the <Routes> for / (LandingPage), /map (ResilienceMapPage), and /analysis (DeepAnalysisPage).

Frontend (LandingPage.jsx)
Aesthetic: A stunning, minimalist, professional entry point.

3D Graphic: Features the <AbstractPlexus.jsx> or the <ResHologram.jsx> as a central, spinning 3D graphic.

Data: Fetches from GET /api/res/overview to display key stats (e.g., "City-Wide RES: 45").

Navigation: A single, prominent, animated button (using react-spring) that says "Enter Command Center" and navigates to /map.

Frontend (ResilienceMapPage.jsx)
Purpose: A dedicated, full-screen view of the 3D map.

NEW: RES Legend (Mandatory): Must render a 2D UI overlay (a legend) that clearly displays the RES ranges and colors:

🔵 Stable (60–100)

Condition: Manageable environmental pressures.

Response: Routine monitoring and maintenance.

🟡 Stressed (30–59)

Condition: Significant pollution or resource strain.

Response: Heightened alert and targeted interventions.

🔴 Critical (0–29)

Condition: Severe risk to health and safety.

Response: Emergency response and maximum mobilization.

Frontend (DelhiGlobe.jsx - on Map Page)
Color Logic: The material-color for each zone must be set using the exact RES ranges and palette (#00f0ff for Stable, #ffc107 for Stressed, #dc3545 for Critical).

Tooltip: onPointerOver shows the <Html> tooltip with zone.name and its exact res_score.

Navigation Logic (CRITICAL): The onPointerDown (click) handler must be updated:

It calls setSelectedZoneId(zone.id) (from AppContext).

It programmatically calls Maps('/analysis') (using the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom).

Frontend (DeepAnalysisPage.jsx)
Purpose: This page replaces the old Sidebar.jsx. It is a 2D, grid-based dashboard for in-depth insights.

Data:

It reads selectedZoneId from AppContext.

If selectedZoneId is null, it displays a "Please select a zone from the map" message.

If selectedZoneId exists, it fetches all detailed data from GET /api/res/zone/:id.

Layout:

Displays the zone name and its current RES/PM2.5.

Displays the probableSource and predictedDeficit strings.

Renders the <TrendChart /> (from /components/charts/).

Renders a table/list of recent action_reports for this zone.

Renders a table/list of community_reports for this zone.

Includes the buttons to open the ActionFormModal and CommunityFormModal.
